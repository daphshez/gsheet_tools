An example for accessing Google Sheets using API v. 4

In order to use it you need to install Google APIs Client Library for Python

   pip install google-api-python-client

You'll also need a file called client_secret.json, which is expected to be in the script directory. To get it: 

1. Go to [dev console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
2. Create new project 
3. Turn on Google Sheets API 
4. Create & download credentials

To run, call

â€‹	`python -m csv_to_gsheet  name_of_spreadsheets file1 file2 file3 ...`

[There's also a walk through video](https://gsuite-developers.googleblog.com/2016/06/introducing-google-sheets-api-v4.html). There are links inside the video to two previous videos with instructions to creating Google Code project, and writing the Python code for OAuth2.
